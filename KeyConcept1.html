<ul>
  <li><strong>Purpose & Model:</strong> HTTP is a stateless clientâ€“server protocol where a browser sends requests and a server returns responses to deliver web resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Version Timeline:</strong> HTTP evolved from 0.9 (GET-only) to 1.0/1.1 (headers, persistent connections, caching) to 2 (binary framing, multiplexing) and 3 (QUIC over UDP) to cut latency and overhead.</li>
  <li><strong>Methods & Status Codes:</strong> Methods like GET (read), POST (submit), and HEAD (metadata) pair with status codes such as 200 OK, 301/302 redirects, 404 Not Found, and 500 Server Error to describe outcomes.</li>
  <li><strong>HTTP/2 Performance:</strong> HTTP/2 speeds pages by multiplexing many streams over one TCP connection, compressing headers with HPACK, and prioritizing critical resources.</li>
  <li><strong>HTTP/3 & QUIC:</strong> HTTP/3 runs over QUIC/UDP to avoid transport head-of-line blocking, enable faster encrypted handshakes, and perform better on mobile or lossy networks.</li>
