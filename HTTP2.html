  <div class="History">
    <p>HTTP/2 was standardized in 2015 and has seen broad adoption, although HTTP/1.1 remains widely used.
    It introduces a binary framing layer that multiplexes multiple requests and responses over a single TCP connection,
    along with HPACK header compression and request prioritization to reduce latency.
    Many large providers adopted HTTP/2 to improve performance and network efficiency.
    Because HTTP semantics are unchanged, it remains backward compatible with HTTP/1.1, enabling gradual, low-risk migration.</p>
